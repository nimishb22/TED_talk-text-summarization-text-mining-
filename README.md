Text mining for TED talk text summarization
TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages![image](https://github.com/nimishb22/TED_talk-text-summarization-text-mining-/assets/20534138/e98bb9fc-1a9a-4850-a9d0-2680a0319212)
The topic chosen for the TED talk text summarization is ‘Education’

10 TED talks on the topic of ‘Education’ are selected and the text of these talks is downloaded.
